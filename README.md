# LungTumorWeights
Repository containing transcriptome weights estimated via The Cancer Genome Atlas adenocarcinoma data. Weights were estimated using the methodology described in "Integrating somatic and germline genetics to identify genes associated with lung cancer", Pattee et al, Genetic Epidemiology (2020): https://doi.org/10.1002/gepi.22275. Both somatic adjusted and unadjusted weights are included. The weight files are structured as follows, with four columns ane one row per SNP:
Column 1: SNP rsID.
Column 2: Active (coded) allele.
Column 3: Reference allele.
Column 4: SNP weight.
